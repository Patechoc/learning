## Bayes Impact - Learning repo

The best way to learn is by doing. Improving at data science is an active process, and this repo focuses on resources for haptic learning. We are building up some good in-house tutorials on how to do particular things, but don't aim to reinvent lessons that are done well elsewhere on the web. Hence we mix notebooks checked in here with links to resources elsewhere.

### Notebooks in this repo

##### Modeling and scikit-learn.ipynb

Basics of loading a dataset (in this case, one included with sklearn) then creating and evaluating some out-of-the-box sklearn models.

##### ROC Curve.ipynb

What a ROC curve is, why it's useful, how to build one, and how to translate one to real-world concepts that non-engineers can understand.

#### External notebooks

##### http://radimrehurek.com/data_science_python/

End-to-end spam filter, beginning with raw data and exploratory analysis, progressing to overfitting, cross-validation, etc. Pandas and sklearn.
